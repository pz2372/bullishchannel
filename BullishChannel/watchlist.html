          Available research data suggests that most day traders are NOT profitable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Studies indicate at least 50% of aspiring day traders will not be profitable. This reiterates that
          consistently making money trading stocks is not easy. Day Trading is a high risk activity and can result in
          the loss of your entire investment. Any trade or investment is at your own risk.
