                  Trading in the stock market is a gradual educational
                  experience. The tuition fee is always present no matter which
                  path you decide to take. Many traders take an unusually high
                  cost of tuition fee by taking the long route– self learning
                  while taking consistent losses. We believe we can drastically
                  cut both the tuition fee of the trader and the learning curve

          Available research data suggests that most day traders are NOT profitable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Studies indicate at least 50% of aspiring day traders will not be profitable. This reiterates that
          consistently making money trading stocks is not easy. Day Trading is a high risk activity and can result in
          the loss of your entire investment. Any trade or investment is at your own risk.
